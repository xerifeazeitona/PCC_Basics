# 3-11. Intentional Error
# If you havenâ€™t received an index error in one of your programs yet, try
# to make one happen. Change an index in one of your programs to produce
# an index error. Make sure you correct the error before closing the program.

examples = ['zero', 'one', 'two']
print(examples[3])

# to fix, simply change the index number to something in the list's 
# range, like: print(examples[2])
