# 3-10. Every Function
# Think of something you could store in a list. For example, you could
# make a list of mountains, rivers, countries, cities, languages, or
# anything else youâ€™d like. Write a program that creates a list
# containing these items and then uses each function introduced in this
# chapter at least once.
