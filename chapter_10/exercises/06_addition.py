10-6. Addition
One common problem when prompting for numerical input occurs when people
provide text instead of numbers. When you try to convert the input to an
int, youâ€™ll get a ValueError. 
Write a program that prompts for two numbers.
Add them together and print the result.
Catch the ValueError if either input value is not a number, and print a
friendly error message.
Test your program by entering two numbers and then by entering some text
instead of a number.
