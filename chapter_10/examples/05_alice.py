"""
One common issue when working with files is handling missing files.
The file youâ€™re looking for might be in a different location, the
filename may be misspelled, or the file may not exist at all.
You can handle all of these situations in a straightforward way with a
try-except block.

except FileNotFoundError:

else:
    # Count the approximate number of words in the file.
    words = contents.split()
    num_words = len(words)
    print(f"The file {filename} has about {num_words} words.")
