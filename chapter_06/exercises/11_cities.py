# Make a dictionary called cities. Use the names of three cities as keys
# in your dictionary. Create a dictionary of information about each city
# and include the country that the city is in, its approximate
# population, and one fact about that city.
# The keys for each cityâ€™s dictionary should be something like country,
# population, and fact.
