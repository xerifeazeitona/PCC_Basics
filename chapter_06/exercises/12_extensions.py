# 6-12. Extensions
# Weâ€™re now working with examples that are complex enough that they can
# be extended in any number of ways. Use one of the example programs
# from this chapter, and extend it by adding new keys and values,
# changing the context of the program or improving the formatting
# of the output.

# 6-10. Favorite Numbers v2
# Modify your program from Exercise 6-2 so each person can have more
# than one favorite number.

# Then print each personâ€™s name along with their favorite numbers in the
# same line, separating numbers with commas and using "and" before the
