# Do the following to create a program that simulates how websites
# ensure that everyone has a unique username.
# Make a list of five or more usernames called current_users.

# two of the new usernames are also in the current_users list.

# Loop through the new_users list to see if each new username has
# already been used. If it has, print a message that the person will
# need to enter a new username. If a username has not been used, print
# a message saying that the username is available.
# Make sure your comparison is case insensitive. If 'John' has been
# used, 'JOHN' should not be accepted. (To do this, youâ€™ll need to
# make a copy of current_users containing the lowercase versions of all
# existing users.)
