"""
8-7. Album
Write a function called make_album() that builds a dictionary describing
a music album. The function should take in an artist name and an album
title, and it should return a dictionary containing these two pieces of
information.
Use None to add an optional parameter to make_album() that allows you to
store the number of songs on an album. If the calling line includes a
value for the number of songs, add that value to the albumâ€™s dictionary.
